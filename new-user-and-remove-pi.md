## How to remove the default pi 
6.9 first ssh into the new user account you just created. Then type in sudo userdel -r pi . This will delete the pi user. If it does not then go to 6.10

6.10 ssh into your new user account. Then sudo raspi-config->1-> S6 and turn off autologin,reboot, and try to redo 6.9
